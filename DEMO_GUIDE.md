### **3. Operator Selection & Tracking (1 minute)**

**Show Edge Case #1: Empty Selection**
1. **Start with no operator selected**
   - Show that proximity tasks panel shows "Select an operator"
   - Demonstrate that distance lines are not visible

**Show Core Functionality:**
2. **Select "John Smith" from dropdown**
   - ✅ Operator becomes highlighted with blue ring

### **4. Proximity-Based Task Prioritization (1 minute)**

**Highlight Smart Features:**
- **Distance calculations** in meters for each task
- **Priority integration** (High/Medium/Low badges)
- **Status tracking** (Pending/In-Progress/Done)
- **Multi-factor sorting** (distance + priority)

**Show Practical Example:**
> *"John Smith is currently 75 meters from 'Excavate Foundation Site A' - his closest high-priority task. The system automatically recommends this over a medium-priority task that might be 200 meters away."*

**Edge Case #2: Operator with No Tasks**
1. **Select "Lisa Chen" (supervisor)**
   - Show graceful handling: "No tasks assigned to this operator"
   - System doesn't crash or show errors

---

### **5. Distance Visualization (30 seconds)**

**Interactive Demo:**
1. **Click "Distances" button**
   - ✅ Blue dashed lines appear connecting operator to all locations
   - ✅ Visual representation of proximity relationships
   - ✅ Toggle on/off functionality works smoothly

**Click on any location:**
- Alert shows exact distance calculation
- Example: "Distance from John Smith to Material Storage: 67 meters"

---

### **6. Manual Movement Simulation (45 seconds)**

**Demonstrate Control:**
1. **Use "Quick Move to Location" dropdown**
   - Select "Construction Zone B"
   - ✅ John Smith moves instantly to new coordinates
   - ✅ Proximity task list updates automatically
   - ✅ Distance calculations recalculate in real-time
   - ✅ New coordinates display updates

**Show Practical Value:**
> *"This simulates an operator moving to a new work area. Notice how the task priorities automatically reorder based on the new location."*

---

### **7. Automated Location Simulation (1 minute)**

**The Showcase Feature:**
1. **Click "Start Sim" button**
   - ✅ Simulation status indicator appears
   - ✅ All active operators begin moving automatically
   - ✅ Machines move more slowly and less frequently
   - ✅ Positions update every 3 seconds

**Real-time Updates to Highlight:**
- Operator coordinates change continuously
- Proximity task list reorders dynamically
- Distance values update in real-time
- Visual movement on the map

**Edge Case #3: Status-Based Movement**
- Point out that only "active" operators move
- "Break" or "offline" operators remain stationary
- Machines only move if status is "active"

**Auto-Stop Feature:**
- Simulation automatically stops after 30 seconds
- Status indicator disappears
- System returns to manual control

---

### **8. Machine Status Integration (30 seconds)**

**Show Machine Information Panel:**
- Real-time machine locations with coordinates
- Fuel levels and operational status
- Operator assignments
- Status-based color coding

**Edge Case #4: Machine Without Location Data**
- Show that machines without coordinates are handled gracefully
- No crashes or undefined errors
- Coordinates only shown when available

---

### **9. Data Management & Edge Cases (30 seconds)**

**Reset Data Functionality:**
1. **Click "🔄 Reset Data" button**
   - ✅ Clears old localStorage data
   - ✅ Loads fresh data with complete location schema
   - ✅ Handles data migration seamlessly

- ✅ localStorage corruption (reset functionality)

### **UI Responsiveness:**
- ✅ Real-time updates without page refresh
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Interactive elements with hover states

### **Business Logic:**

## 🚀 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Expected Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How accurate are the distance calculations?"**
**A:** *"Currently using Euclidean distance formula suitable for flat construction sites. For hilly terrain, we can implement elevation-aware calculations."*

**Q: "Can this work with real GPS data?"**
**A:** *"Absolutely. The coordinate system is designed to accept any x,y input - whether from simulation, GPS, or indoor positioning systems."*

**Q: "What about offline scenarios?"**
**A:** *"The system works entirely offline using localStorage. Perfect for remote construction sites with limited connectivity."*

**Q: "How does this scale with more operators?"**
**A:** *"The current architecture handles dozens of entities efficiently. For hundreds, we'd implement virtual scrolling and data pagination."*

**Q: "What's the real-world implementation timeline?"**
**A:** *"Core location tracking: 2-3 weeks. GPS integration: 1-2 weeks. RFID/IoT sensors: 3-4 weeks depending on hardware."*
