SMART DIGITAL
OPERATORS
By TrialBla@zers4

INTRODUCTION
Heavy equipment operators face safety risks and
performance challenges in mining & construction.
Smart Digital Operators assist them through real-time
monitoring and task guidance.
This solution integrates machine data, safety alerts, and
productivity tools on a web-based platform.

OBJECTIVES
✔️ Improve operator safety compliance
✔️ Simplify daily machine operation workflows
✔️ Predict task completion times for better planning
✔️ Monitor and analyze machine behavior in real-time

FEATURES
Machine Behavior Monitoring (Engine hours, idle time, fuel usage)
Safety Alerts (Seatbelt status, hazard proximity detection)
Daily Task Dashboard (Shift goals & checklists)
Task Time Estimation (Basic predictive logic)
Training Hub (Operator learning modules)

WORKFLOW

PROPOSED SOLUTION

Task Assignment & Monitoring:
Admin can assign tasks to operators with detailed instructions and safety
guidelines.
Operator Dashboard:
Operators can view scheduled tasks, mark progress, and stay updated in real
time.
Interactive E-Learning Module:
Operators can watch training videos, ask questions, and receive contextual
answers.
Context-Aware Q&A using LLM:
Video are converted to intelligent responses.
Proximity Hazard Detection:
GPS-based telematics system is used to detect nearby hazards; distances are
calculated using Haversine distance for Accuracy at Construction Scale and
safety alerts.

SAFETY AND ALERTS
Alerts for seatbelt violations and unsafe proximity
Warnings for excessive idle time
Encourages completion of shift tasks efficiently

BENEFITS
Enhances operator safety with real-time alerts for
seatbelt status and proximity hazards.
Improves machine productivity by minimizing idle
time and optimizing load cycles.
Provides operators with clear daily task lists and
progress tracking.
Enables hands-free operation using a voice assistant
for safer and faster interactions.
Promotes operator learning and upskilling via
integrated training modules.

FUTURE SCOPE
Integration with real Caterpillar Product Link™ and
MineStar™ sensors
AI-powered task time prediction and fatigue detection
Environmental hazard alerts (weather, dust)
Voice-based operator assistance & mobile app support

CONCLUSION
Smart digital operator system creates a safer and more
efficient work environment. The prototype, built using
modern web technologies, shows the potential for further
development with real sensor integration, AI-based
analysis, and predictive maintenance. This project lays a
strong foundation for smarter, more connected mining
operations, promoting digital transformation in heavy
industries.
