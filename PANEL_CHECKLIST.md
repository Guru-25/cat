## 💡 **Quick Answers for Common Questions**

**Q: "How long to implement with real hardware?"**
**A:** "2-3 weeks for basic GPS tracking, 4-6 weeks for full RFID/IoT integration"

**Q: "What's the accuracy?"**
**A:** "Simulation uses meter-level precision. Real implementation depends on hardware - GPS typically 1-3m, RFID can be sub-meter"

**Q: "Cost of implementation?"**
**A:** "Software development: covered. Hardware: $50-200 per operator for basic GPS, $200-500 for RFID/beacons"

**Q: "Offline capability?"**
**A:** "Fully offline capable using localStorage. Perfect for remote sites with poor connectivity"

**Q: "What about privacy concerns?"**
**A:** "Location tracking only during work hours, data stored locally, operators can see their own data, transparent policies"
